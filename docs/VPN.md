# VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- Virtual private network is an encrypted connection to a private network.
- The encryption of data ensures the privacy and security of the information transmitted.
- Different protocols are used for different VPNs.  

## VPN Protocols
Below is a photo of VyprVPN's settings page for protocols. 
1. Chameleon (256-bit encryption)
Chameleon is one of the best VPN protocols to use in China. It is customly developed by Vypr, thus made more difficult for the government and ISPs to track its traffic. 256-bit encryption means it uses a 256-bit key to encrypt data. It is one of the most secure encryption method after 128-bit and 192-bit.
2. OpenVPN
OpenVPN is the fastest VPN protocol, but it could be intercepted, therefore not working well in China. However, in uncensored countries it performs the best.
3. L2TP/IPSec
L2TP/IPSec combination of protocols is the most universal on desktops, laptops and mobile phones, with built-in support for it. It offers a more secure connection, but slower speed than OpenVPN.
