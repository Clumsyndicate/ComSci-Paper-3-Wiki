Representational state transfer is an architectural style that describes the set of protocol used in creating a service from the internet, in terms of how resources are efficiently allocated or dispatched. Application or structure that implements this style is referred as RESTful or REST-style.  

An application or architecture considered RESTful or REST-style is characterized by: 

* State of service and application functionality are separated into distributed resources 

* Every resource is uniquely addressable using a uniform and minimal set of commands (typically using HTTP commands of GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE over the Internet) 

* The protocol is client/server, stateless, layered, and supports caching
