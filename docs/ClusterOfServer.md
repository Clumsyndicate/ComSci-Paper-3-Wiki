# API (application programming interface)
The collection of some predefined function. The main function is to enable the programmers to use a group of routine based on simple programs. Therefore, the programmers do not have to access to the source code.

It is one of the most essential roles for the operation system.

## Example:
We can open a certain file using the function fopen() in C language. The function fopen()is an example of API design for C so that it can enable the user to use a simple function to finish a serial of operation. 

Without such API function, the user have to search and open the file by himself which is very complex.
