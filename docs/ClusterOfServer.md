# Cluster of server
Is a computer program that allows server computers to work together as a computer cluster, to provide failover and increased availability of applications, or parallel calculating power in case of high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.

# API (application programming interface)
The collection of some predefined function. The main function is to enable the programmers to use a group of routine based on simple programs. Therefore, the programmers do not have to access to the source code.

### The role of API in operation system.
Here is the main roles of operation system.

It is one of the most essential roles for the operation system.

## Example:
We can open a certain file using the function fopen() in C language. The function fopen()is an example of API design for C so that it can enable the user to use a simple function to finish a serial of operation. 

Without such API function, the user have to search and open the file by himself which is very complex and time consuming. 

We have to 
1. scan the hard disk
2. find the location of the file we want
3. load some data from the file then send to the I/O cash, into the memory
4. Convert the results(0, 1) into letters using ASCLL form or Unicode.
5. display

in order to open a simple file. Therefore, design a proper and useful API is necessary for a new CAD system.
